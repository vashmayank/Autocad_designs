## 📌 What is a Guide Base?

A guide base is used to align and guide mechanical parts in machinery, often forming part of a jig or fixture. It helps ensure linear motion and proper assembly positioning, especially where accuracy is critical.

## 🛠️ Design Process

1. **Research & Reference**  
   Referenced textbooks and industry guides to understand dimensions and tolerancing.

2. **2D Drafting in AutoCAD**  
   Created detailed sketches including hole placements, clearances, and fit dimensions.

3. **3D Modeling**  
   Built a 3D version of the design to evaluate assembly fit.

4. **Sheet Preparation**  
   Used `VIEWBASE` in AutoCAD to generate orthographic views and annotations for fabrication.
