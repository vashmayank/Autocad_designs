# 🔩 Universal Coupling – CAD Design Project

This project showcases a complete mechanical design and technical documentation of a **Universal Coupling**, modeled and drafted using **AutoCAD** by **Mayank**, a mechanical design engineering student with a focus on production-ready CAD documentation.

---

## 📐 Project Scope

The Universal Coupling was modeled in 3D and detailed on **ISO A3 technical sheets** using **first angle projection**, proper **engineering tolerances**, and **material specifications**. The final output is ready for manufacturing or academic portfolio demonstration.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔧 **7 fully-detailed part models and drawings:**
  - Fork
  - Shaft
  - Center Block
  - Pin
  - Collar
  - Key
  - Taper Pin
- 🧩 **1 Full Assembly Drawing**
  - Includes sectional and isometric views
  - Fully referenced **Bill of Materials (BOM)**
  - Part balloons and fit notes

---

## 🛠️ Engineering Standards Applied

- 📐 **First Angle Projection**
- 🧪 **Fit Systems**:
  - H7 fits for holes and shafts
  - Taper fits for pin locking
- 🔩 **Materials**:
  - EN8 / Mild Steel
  - Hardened Steel for taper pin
- 🎯 **Surface Finish**: 1.6 µm Ra on machined surfaces
- 🗂️ **Tolerances**:
  - Hole diameters with H7 or ±0.02 mm
  - Shaft and feature lengths ±0.1 mm
  - Angular ±0.5°
