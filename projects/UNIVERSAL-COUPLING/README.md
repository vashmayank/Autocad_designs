## 📐 Project Overview

This universal coupling was designed using **AutoCAD**, including:
- Full 3D modeling of every part
- ISO A3 detailed drawings for each part
- Fit tolerances and machining specs
- A professional final assembly drawing
- A documented project portfolio (PDF)

## 🧩 Components Modeled

- FORK
- SHAFT
- CENTER BLOCK
- PIN
- COLLAR
- KEY
- TAPER PIN
- ASSEMBLY (with full BOM and views)

## 📏 Engineering Standards Applied

- 🧭 **Projection Type**: First Angle Projection
- 📐 **Tolerances**:
  - Holes: H7 fit / ±0.01–0.02 mm
  - Shafts and keys: clearance/interference based on ISO fits
  - General: ±0.1 mm, angular ±0.5°
- ⚙️ **Materials**:
  - Mild Steel (EN8)
  - Hardened Steel (EN31) for pins and taper pins
- 🎯 **Surface Finish**: 1.6 µm Ra on machined surfaces
