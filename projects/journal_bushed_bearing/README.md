## üìå What is a Bushed Journal Bearing?

A bushed journal bearing is a type of plain bearing that supports a rotating shaft within a stationary housing using a replaceable bronze bush. It reduces friction and supports radial loads, commonly used in mechanical and automotive systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Process

1. **Research & References**  
   Referred to a mechanical engineering textbook and online sources for standard sizes and tolerances.

2. **2D Drafting in AutoCAD**  
   Created detailed sketches including features like oil holes, H7 fits, and specified surface finishes.

3. **3D Modeling**  
   Developed a 3D model from the 2D sketch to check fit and assembly.

4. **Sheet Generation**  
   Used `VIEWBASE` in AutoCAD to generate orthographic and sectional views with proper dimensioning for the final A3 drawing sheet.
