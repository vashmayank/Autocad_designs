# ✍️ AutoCAD Mechanical Designs – by Mayank

This repository is a curated collection of **mechanical engineering CAD projects** developed using **AutoCAD (Educational Version)**. It reflects my individual effort to master **2D and 3D design**, **tolerance application**, and **assembly drafting** through real-world inspired components.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This repository serves as a portfolio of my independent mechanical design work. My aim is to:
- Apply engineering knowledge to practical CAD problems  
- Reinforce mechanical design principles like fits, tolerances, and manufacturability  
- Build a high-quality, self-documented design library for future reference and learning

Each project is researched, modeled, and documented fully by me.

## 📁 Folder Overview

```
Autocad_designs/
├── LINEAR-RAIL-BLOCK/         # Linear guide assembly with full part modeling and project report
├── UNIVERSAL-COUPLING/        # CAD design of a mechanical universal joint with projections
├── journal_bushed_bearing/    # Detailed view and modeling of a journal bearing assembly
└── README.md                  # This documentation file
```

Each folder includes:
- 📐 **DWG files** – for 2D/3D part and assembly modeling (NOT IN ALL PROJECTS)
- 🖼️ **Screenshots** – visual reference images  
- 📄 **PDF drawings** – finalized 2D layout sheets (A3, ISO format)  
- 🧾 **Project reports** – overview, methods, and skills gained (when applicable)

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Part modeling and 2D drafting  
- Application of tolerances (e.g., H7, M4 clearance fits)  
- Creating section views, BOMs, and exploded diagrams  
- Sheet layout, title blocks, and annotation standards  
- Engineering documentation and CAD file organization
