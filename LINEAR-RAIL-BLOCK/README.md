## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Linear Rail Block** is used in CNC and automation systems for accurate linear motion. The project involves the full design and documentation of the following parts:

- 🧱 **Base Block** – with Ø15 H7 holes for guide rollers  
- 🔩 **Clamping Plate** – top fixture to hold the rollers  
- 🌀 **Guide Rollers** – Ø15 Tool Steel pins for motion guidance  
- 🧷 **M4 Socket Head Cap Screws** – DIN 912 standard, for clamping
